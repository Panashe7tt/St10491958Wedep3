3/11/2025- fistly based on my feedback from my part two the only changes that i have made is that i have added the light button since everthing was working perfectly in part2 and my lectures did not ask me to make any changes.
7/11/2025 - Im asked to create a map so i have chosen despatch that is where the company location wll be at
10/11/2025 - i have decided to change my css colour styling from gray to blue and white to make it match with the logo of the company and also to make it look neat. i also have changed the location to booysenpark shoping center because that is the nearest place for a company to have an office 
10/11/2025 - i have also created the enquiry and contact form for the user to get more information from the owners of the company and also to make complaints if they have any so that the company can know what to improve in the company to make its customers happy.
i have also add the validatioon for thhe users that will capture the correct details
11/11/2025 - i have added the registration form it is not realy required but it is not public in the website so the reason for this is that the company might need it in the future when they perhaps need to hire employees.
12/11/2025 - here im testing my website to see everything function perfectly
